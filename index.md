### Coursework Projects: 
Below are examples of my work completed as part of my Master of City Planning degree at the University of Pennsylvania Weitzman School of Design. Projects are focused on urban planning and public policy and employ advanced spatial analysis, data science, and machine learning.

[Predicting Home Prices in Miami](https://github.com/HLWag/ParkWagner_MidtermMUSA508)
Zillowâ€™s housing market predictions, known as Zestimates, are valued for their nationwide coverage and general accuracy. For example, the nationwide median error for off-market homes is 7.5% and for on-market homes is 1.9%. However, when considering a specific city or region, the accuracy of the Zestimates could be improved by including locally-specific data in the prediction process. This analysis aims to build an accurate and generalizable hedonic model that predicts home prices for Miami by deconstructing overall home price into the value of constituent parts.

[Transit Oriented Development in Chicago](https://github.com/HLWag/MUSA508_TOD-Assignment)
This analysis aims to determine whether households in Chicago, Illinois value transit-rich neighborhoods compared to other neighborhoods. Known as Transit Oriented Development (TOD), this type of urban development aims to maximize the amount of housing and amenities within walking distance of transit like bus stops, subways stations, and rail stations. Understanding whether renters and home buyers are willing to pay more to reside near transit can help cities manage zoning codes. If residents in Chicago prioritize living in transit-rich areas (i.e., areas within a half-mile of Chicago Transit Authority [CTA] stations) at the expense of housing cost, then the City may wish to update zoning codes to enable increased density around transit.

[Dispacement Risk Tracker](https://ashabazil.github.io/DisplacementRiskTracker_Wagner_Bazil_12.14.2020.html)
This analysis aims to create a predictive model that can be used by city housing departments across the United States as a means of forecasting and preventing potential residential displacement. We pilot this idea with the Philadelphia Division of Housing and Community Development in mind, in an effort to help the division allocate limited housing resources to vulnerable residents.

Housing Credit Allocation
This analysis uses a binary logistic regression to estimate whether eligible homeowners are likely to take a home repair tax credit based on a number of features (e.g., age, education level, marital status, unemployment rate). our goal is to create a model that can accurately predict instances of when a homeowner will and will not take the credit.
